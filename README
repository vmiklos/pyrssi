= WAP Interface for Irssi
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos-at-vmiklos-dot-hu>

NOTE: I'm not really interested in working on this anymore, as it
fulfills my need. However, I can understand someone else might want to
try the same, so I put the code online to avoid double work.

== What's pyrssi?

pyrssi is a successor for irssi-mobile. It provides a WAP interface so that you
can control your client from your mobile phone.

== Why is it better than irssi-mobile?

- handles private messaging (that was the most important for me)

- it allows you do anything, join/part channels, op, kick, etc.

- it fetches the last lines from the window's buffer so that you'll see
  everything you see in your client, including joins/quits, /names output, etc.

- it uses a unix socket, rather than a port, which is quite useful in multiuser
  environment

- other reasons I forgot ;)

== How does it work?

First you need
http://github.com/msparks/irssiscripts/raw/1e6d50bf541b1bb991f1ece883ad3b6aa6040783/socket-interface.pl[socket-interface.pl]
so that you'll have a socket in your ~/.irssi/socket. Then you need
pyrssi.py, that cgi will connect to the socket and will generate the wap
pages.

Don't forget to edit pyrssi.config: the sha1sum of your password and the socket
path!

== FAQ

'Q: How frequent does it refresh?'

``A: It does not. If you send an empty text then it will.''

'Q: My window list is looooong. Is it possible to switch between windows
without listing all of them?'

``A: Yes, just use /g windownum or /g #channelname.''

'Q: Is it possible to start a new query and switch to it immediately?'

``A: Yes, use /q nick to to so.''

'Q: I already do HTTP auth, could you please disable the built-in auth?'

``A: Yes, sure. Just set your password to empty.''

'Q: The activity list is too long. How to make it shorter?'

``A: All channels are shown by default. You can define the list of channels to
be displayed in pyrssi.config like this:''
